GNU Ada on Linux
=================

Due to extensive refinement, the AdaCore Ada 
compiler produces executables on linux that 
are less fussy about their shared libraries 
than the GNU-Ada compiler, GNAT. 

A GNAT build might require using the patchelf 
command to modify shared libraries with inter-
dependencies.

This is NOT the case using AdaCore.

One example is the freetype library needs to
know, at link time, where it can find the PNG
library it requires, assuming that a  usable
system lib with the same name is not found.
The ldd command applied to the executable 
makes this clear. 

Typically the PNG library is collocated, 
in which case the command:

patchelf --set-rpath '$ORIGIN' libfreetype.so.6.12.1

tells freetype that libpng.so is in the same
directory.

The link will fail without this modification.
