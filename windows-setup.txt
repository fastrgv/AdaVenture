Microsoft Windows Setup
========================

Open a Command Line Terminal window.

If you have a previous installation of the game on your computer, 
then delete it by typing something like:

	RMDIR/S <game-installation-directory>\<game-dir>

from the command line terminal.

This will save space on your computer's disk drive, and will 
help to avoid confusion.


Next, move the newest archive, a 7z file 
[from your Downloads directory] to any directory of your choosing:

	move <file-name>.extension <game-installation-directory>

	cd <game-installation-directory>

Next, unzip the 7z archive:

A) If you have it, PeaZip seems to work fine for all archive types.

B) If you do not already have an unzip utility, I recommend 
downloading 7z [from www.7-zip.org].  It's free, and works nicely.
From the Command Line Terminal type:

	7z x <file-name>.7z [this unzips contents to a new game-dir]

	cd <game-dir>

Then issue the proper commandline syntax to start the app.

Note that WSL [Windows Subsystem for Linux] is NOT supported.
Simply use the Windows executable provided. Runs on Windows 10 & 11.

Note also that an error message like "vcruntime140.dll is missing" 
indicates that you should install, repair, or reinstall, the MSVC 
redistributable runtime libraries for both x86 and x64. 
As of 10aug24 that is version 14.40.33810.0 (2022).

December 2025 addendum:
--------------------------------------------------------------------
According to GPT it seems that vcruntime140.dll is not included in 
Windows 11 by default. It is part of the Microsoft Visual C++ 
Redistributables package [msvcr], which is used to run applications 
developed with Visual C++.

There are many apps that might install msvcr, possibly without
your knowledge. If your system does not already have it installed 
you will encounter an error when trying to run my games.

If so, you should download & install 2 files from Microsoft,
one for "x86" and one for "x64". These packages will ensure that the 
necessary runtime components are available for any applications 
that depend on them, including my games.

Here are the 2 permalinks I found for the latest supported versions:

https://aka.ms/vc14/vc_redist.x86.exe
https://aka.ms/vc14/vc_redist.x64.exe

They were free, quick, & easy downloads of 2 self-installing files:

VC_redist.x86.exe
VC_redist.x64.exe
